 * Loads the appropriate example code, as indicated by the appropriate compiler build setting below.
 *
 * To select an example to run, define one (and only one) of the macros below, either by
 * adding a #define XXX statement at the top of this file, or more flexibily, by adding the
 * macro value to the Preprocessor Macros (aka GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS) compiler setting.
 *
 * To add a compiler setting, select the project in the Xcode Project Navigator panel,
 * select the Build Settings panel, and add the value to the Preprocessor Macros
 * (aka GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS) entry.
 *
 * For example, to run the pipelines example, you would add the MVK_pipelines define macro
 * to the Preprocessor Macros (aka GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS) entry of the Xcode project,
 * overwriting any other value there.
 *
 * If you choose to add a #define statement to this file, be sure to clear the existing macro
 * from the Preprocessor Macros (aka GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS) compiler setting in Xcode.
